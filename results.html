                                    <div class="description">I found user interviews to be extremely helpful because it allowed me to directly speak to people who would look at my site and for them to provide me with information on ways to improve the usability of my site. The most important part of user interviews are preparing strong questions for the interviewees. Some of the questions I asked were "What type of features do you think are a must in a personal portfolio?" and "What are some things you think one should avoid when creating a personal portfolio?".</div>

                                    <div class="description">I found the competitor anlysis to be helpful because it showed me the strengths of some of the people in my field but also some of the weaknesses so I knew what to try and do but also what to avoid doing. I reviewed some of the personal portfolios that I found online and some that my friends have done. I kept track of notable features that I would also try to implement into my own site. I also kept track of overall weaknesses and avoided any that I found in other websites.</div>

                                    <div class="description">I created a feature value matrix which was a list of features I was planning to implement into my personal portfolio and ranks of how important they were to have them implemented and how hard they were to actually implement. This was extremely helpful because I could implement the features with the highest user and business value and the lowest development effort first, and then leave the features with lower value and high effort for later or completely out of my design.</div>

A picture of it can be viewed by clicking on the title of this box. The Kano Model was also nice by putting the features on the cartesian plane, features in the top right were most important and features in the bottom left would either be implemented last or left out.</div>

                                    <div class="description">User stories were helpful because they helped me think of what type of users would be using the features on my portfolio and if each feature was completing an objective for each type of user. For creating my user stories I had to make sure I knew what type of people would be visiting my portfolio so I made some stories for hiring manager, technical leads, and even other peers or general users. Then I had each user look at each of my features and see if they were getting the correct information out of each one.</div>

                                    <div class="description">The cognitive walkthrough was helpful in that it showed me how infrequent users would go through my portfolio. I already had an idea of how my portfolio would be used but I was surprised that some features were not as obvious to others as it was to me. The congitive wakthrough helped me change portions of my website such as the projects section to make more sense to all users of my portfolio.</div>

                                    <div class="description">For the user testing, I used click tests and question tests for users to answer online using Usability Hub. I really liked using click tests because they were very simple to create and the heat maps of clicks were very helpful in seeing where most users click or where they could get confused. I noticed for my contacts a lot of people got confused where to click eventhough for me it was obvious. I also like question tests because I could ask questions asking why they thought a certain aspect of my portfolio was how it was. For example, I asked what they would do to reach a certain section of my page, and why they thought that.</div>

                                User interviews gave me insight into what different users would be expecting from my personal portfolio. I got to learn what some users valued more and what some users did not think was
                                necessary to put in a portfolio. I was able to combine all my interviewees opinions together to decide what features belonged in my portfolio.<br> hi</h5>
